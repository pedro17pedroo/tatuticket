# TatuTicket - Multi-Tenant Ticket Management System

## Overview

TatuTicket is a modern, multi-tenant ticket management system designed to transform customer support operations. The application features a modular architecture with four distinct portals: SaaS Portal for prospecting and sales, Organization Portal for internal ticket management, Customer Portal for self-service, and Admin Portal for global system administration. Built with React, Express, and PostgreSQL, the system leverages Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities and provides real-time analytics, AI-powered automation, and flexible SLA management.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
The client uses React with TypeScript in a Single Page Application (SPA) pattern. The UI is built with shadcn/ui components and Tailwind CSS for consistent styling. The application implements a Progressive Web App (PWA) with service workers for offline capabilities and app-like experience. Navigation is handled through Wouter for client-side routing, and state management uses React Query for server state and React hooks for local state.

### Backend Architecture
The server follows an Express.js REST API pattern with TypeScript. The application uses a middleware-based architecture for request processing, authentication, and error handling. Routes are organized by functionality and registered centrally. The system implements proper error handling with structured error responses and comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring.

### Database Layer
PostgreSQL is used as the primary database with Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations. The schema implements multi-tenancy with tenant isolation at the database level. Key entities include users, tenants, tickets, departments, teams, customers, knowledge articles, SLA configurations, and audit logs. The database supports relationships between entities and uses UUIDs for primary keys.

### Authentication and Authorization
The system implements a role-based access control (RBAC) system with support for multiple user roles: user, agent, manager, admin, and super_admin. Authentication is handled through a custom service with session management. Each portal has specific access controls, and the system supports tenant-based authorization to ensure data isolation between organizations.

### Multi-Tenant Architecture
The application is designed with tenant isolation in mind. Each tenant has their own data space while sharing the same application instance. Tenant identification is handled through subdomains or tenant IDs, and all database queries are scoped to the appropriate tenant. This ensures complete data isolation and security between different organizations.

### Development Tooling
The project uses Vite for fast development builds and hot module replacement. TypeScript provides type safety across the entire stack. The build process supports both development and production environments with appropriate optimizations. ESBuild is used for server-side bundling to ensure fast startup times.
